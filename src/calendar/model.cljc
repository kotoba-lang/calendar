(defn- instant-ranks
  "An order-preserving embedding of `instants` into the `:i64` the guest
  speaks: each value's rank is how many of them compare strictly below it.

  Only `compare` is consulted, which is the ordering this namespace has always
  used, and rank is monotone in it — `rank x < rank y` exactly when
  `(neg? (compare x y))`. So the guest's four comparisons get the same answers
  they would have got on the instants themselves, whether those are the
  ISO-8601 strings this model stores or the integers a test hands it. This is
  not the rule; it is putting the rule's inputs into its domain.

  One consequence worth naming: ranking asks `compare` about every pair, where
  the old inline conjunction stopped at the first guard that failed. Instants
  that cannot be compared with each other now throw where a malformed event
  could previously short-circuit to `false`. Both are refusals of the same
  data; homogeneous instants — everything this model produces — are unaffected."

  "Do `a` and `b` occupy a common instant?

  The rule is `model.kotoba/overlaps?`, executed from
  `resources/calendar/oracle/model.kir.edn`; this function does not compute
  it. What is left here is what is not a decision: reading the two maps,
  refusing an absent instant, and ranking the four instants into `:i64`.

  Absence is the one thing the guest cannot express — `:i64` has no `nil` —
  so it stays here. An event missing either end has not said when it happens,
  and a thing that has not said when it happens is not concurrent with
  anything.

  The rule itself, for a reader who wants it stated rather than fetched: each
  event must occupy time at all, and under half-open `[start, end)` an empty
  interval intersects nothing. That guard used to be missing from this side
  while `validate/event-problems` reported the same events as
  `:event/non-positive-duration` and `model.kotoba/overlaps?` refused them
  outright — so the two implementations of this rule disagreed and the one
  that ran was the permissive one. There is now one implementation."
